# NN from scratch

A Dense Layer implemented with only NumPy, complete with activation functions, forward and back propagation. It can be used to make a Deep Neural Network with any number of such Dense Layers. In the notebook, I have used it to make a Neural Network with just 2 layers that got > 90% accuracy on multi class classification on the MNIST dataset.
